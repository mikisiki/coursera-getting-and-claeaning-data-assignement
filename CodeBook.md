The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 

For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 
These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  '-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

-mean(): Mean value
-std(): Standard deviation
-mad(): Median absolute deviation 
-max(): Largest value in array
-min(): Smallest value in array
-sma(): Signal magnitude area
-energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
-iqr(): Interquartile range 
-entropy(): Signal entropy
-arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
-correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
-maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
-meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
-skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
-kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
-bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
-angle(): Angle between to vectors.

The script creates two data files. 

The first one, merged_data, consists of extracted mean and standard deviation values of the variables of the feature 
vector for each pattern, merges it with the subject and activity data and names accordingly.

The second data set containes average value of mean and standard deviation values of the above variables summarised for each subject 
and activity. Variable 1 represents subject, variable 2 an activity, variables 3 to 81 represent average ofaverage of each variable from the merged data
for each activity and each subject
